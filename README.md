To check if your computer meets these specifications...
* **On Mac**, click on the Apple menu icon at the top of your screen. In the
dropdown menu, choose "About This Mac". The specifications should
look similar to Figure [1.1](#figure1-1). For more information, see how [Apple explains
computer specifications](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203001).
&nbsp;
* **On Linux**, you may need to use a terminal that accepts command
lines to figure out the specifications. Figure [1.2](#figure1-2) is a reference of what
the specifications look like on Ubuntu 18.04.1, though this may appear
differently for different Linux systems. You check out this Stack Exchange
post for answers related to Ubuntu: [askUbuntu - How do I check system
specifications?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/55609/how-do-i-check-system-specifications)

After the installation, to verify that the system can deliver audio output,
**you need some way to input and output audio**. Ideally, a working
device such as a headset or pair of headphones would be used, but your
computer’s built-in microphone and speakers are good enough as long as the
volume settings are not set to mute.
#### _1\.1\.3 Installation Requirements_
Finally, these are the additional applications and tools needed to successfully
install OSP
* **Command Terminal**: You will need to know how to operate the
command terminal with working knowledge of basic terminal commands
and features. This is to navigate through different folders and operate
OSP after installation. Fortunately, this guide will cover all of the
commands needed, as long as you follow the steps in order.
* **GitHub and git**: Our files are stored online via our GitHub page.
You will need to install git within the terminal, if this hasn’t been
done already.
